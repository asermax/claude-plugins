# Report

A report is what the user reads after the work is done: the answer to a question, the findings of an investigation, the summary of a change. This is not the design tree, the annotation loop, or a document going into the project's docs. Those have their own shape.

Load `superpowers:unslop` first, before writing anything. Hold its rules while drafting the report, the same way you hold the rules below. Its agent pass is for documents; there is no pass here. Write clean the first time. When the skill is not installed, say so and continue.

## Lead with the answer

State the answer or the conclusion first. The investigation, the searches, the rounds of questions that produced it come after, as support. A reader who only has time for the first sentence should still walk away knowing the answer.

## Diagram what reads clearer as a picture

A flow across components, a relationship, a structure with several parts reads clearer as a diagram than as prose. Validate every diagram with `superpowers:mermaid-validation` before it is shown; when that skill is not installed, say so and show the diagram unvalidated.

## Separate what is verified from what is claimed

A pitch, a ticket, a doc can assert something the code does not back up. Say which is which. When a verified fact contradicts a claim or a decision already made, say so plainly, in the first sentence, not folded into a paragraph where it reads as one more detail.

## Report only what bears on the ask

An investigation touches more than it needs to report. Cut what does not serve the question asked or the decision at hand.

## Structure by what the reader needs, not by where it came from

When several searches, agents, or rounds feed one report, organize it around the questions they answer, not around which one produced which piece. "Agent 1 found X, agent 2 found Y" tells the reader about the work, not about the answer.

## Name what you refer to

Refer to code, rows, questions and items by their name or by what they do, not by a bare pointer. Write "the delete button in the student editor removes by the sorted index", not ":120"; write "the collision question", not "Q4". A line number, row id or question number on its own makes the reader stop and look it up before the sentence means anything. A `file:line` reference can follow the name as a pointer to the place, but it never stands in for the name.
