## Notes

<!--
Visual Documentation (rarely needed for ADRs):

If code examples or technical diagrams would help clarify the decision, embed them inline.
See: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/framework-core/references/code-examples.md
See: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/framework-core/references/technical-diagrams.md

Most ADRs should not need code examples or diagrams - they document technology/architecture choices,
not implementation patterns.
