# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE-ID]

**Feature Spec**: [../feature-specs/FEATURE-ID.md](../feature-specs/FEATURE-ID.md)
**Feature Design**: [../feature-designs/FEATURE-ID.md](../feature-designs/FEATURE-ID.md)
**Status**: Not Started | In Progress | Complete

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Read the spec
- [ ] Read the design
- [ ] Read dependency code: [list files]
- [ ] Review relevant ADRs: [list ADR-NNN]
- [ ] Review relevant design patterns: [list DES-NNN]

## Team Structure

> Include this section only when the plan was created with team mode enabled and team separation is viable.

| Agent | Scope | Steps |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **[Agent Name]** | [Language/area]: [specific concerns] | Steps N–M |

**Synchronization**: [cross-agent dependencies and ordering constraints]

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Description]

- Create/modify: `src/path/to/file`
- What to do: [specific instructions]
- Test: [how to verify this step]

### Step 2: [Description]

- Create/modify: `src/path/to/file`
- What to do: [specific instructions]
- Test: [how to verify this step]

### Step N: Verify Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Run tests for each acceptance criterion
- [ ] Manual verification: [what to check]

> **Note on code snippets**: Use snippets to show *where* code goes and *what* it should do (via comments),
> not the complete implementation. The implementation agent has full access to spec, design, and decision
> documents—plans provide structural guidance, not code.

## Files Changed

- [ ] `src/...` - [purpose of changes]
- [ ] `tests/...` - [purpose of changes]

## Notes

[Anything discovered during implementation, deviations from plan, learnings]
