# Human review

Verifies the user's own reading of a change and settles it with them. Nothing is edited until they rule on it.

When both review skills run, mahou:agentic-review goes first. It clears the mechanical findings so this pass spends attention on judgment instead.

The annotations come from the `plannotator` CLI, which is a separate install. When it is not on the PATH, say so and stop.

## Step 1: Establish the changeset

Load mahou:changeset. It gives you the repository paths you dispatch against, and the rule that tells you whether what an annotation flags was introduced by this change or predates it.

## Step 2: Collect the annotations

Start one `plannotator review` per repository, backgrounded, all in a single message:

```
cd {absolute-repo-path} && plannotator review
```

Backgrounding is what keeps that `cd` safe, because it never changes the session's working directory. Address repositories everywhere else the way `changeset` says.

Keep a map of repository to task so every result is attributed. Never poll. Completions arrive on their own.

## Step 3: Work each repository as its annotations land

Handle a repository the moment its result arrives, start to finish, and never hold a finished one behind a slow one.

### Verify

Annotations are unverified input. They carry what the user wants, not always the full context.

Read the flagged lines before responding. Establish whether the change introduced what is flagged or whether it predates the change, which `changeset` covers. Then give each annotation a verdict, either Confirmed, Partly, Not a bug, or Intended, with the lines that settle it quoted.

Report the base `plannotator` used alongside the changeset base. They can differ, and when they do the annotations cover a smaller diff than the changeset does.

### Present

Not every annotation is a finding. Some approve, some remove, some ask a question. Answer the questions first, because an answer changes what gets applied.

Change nothing yet. Never apply the obvious ones unasked. Never argue a finding down: if you believe it is wrong, say why in one line and let the user rule. A "Not a bug" verdict is your reading, not a decision. The user routinely overrides it, and that is the correct outcome.

### Apply what the user approves

Before writing code, read the project's `CLAUDE.md` and `.mahou/basics.md` when present, and consult mahou:wiki for the technologies the fix touches. Follow the conventions of the repository you are in.

Run that repository's linters and tests afterwards, scoped to the files you touched rather than the whole tree. A blanket formatter run reformats unrelated files and drags them into the change.

Leave everything uncommitted.
