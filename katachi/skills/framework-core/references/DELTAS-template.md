# Delta Inventory

Deltas (work items) extracted from VISION.md for [project name].

## Status Tracking

Deltas track their progress through the development workflow using a status field:

- **✗ Defined** - Delta extracted and documented (initial state)
- **⧗ Spec** - Specification in progress (`/spec-delta` started)
- **✓ Spec** - Specification complete (`/spec-delta` done)
- **⧗ Design** - Design rationale in progress (`/design-delta` started)
- **✓ Design** - Design complete (`/design-delta` done)
- **⧗ Plan** - Implementation plan in progress (`/plan-delta` started)
- **✓ Plan** - Implementation plan complete (`/plan-delta` done)
- **⧗ Implementation** - Delta implementation in progress (`/implement-delta` started)
- **✓ Implementation** - Delta complete and tested (`/implement-delta` done)
- **✓ Reconciled** - Feature documentation updated (`/reconcile-delta` done)

Commands automatically update status as they progress. To manually update:
```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status set DELTA-ID "STATUS"
```

Query status:
```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status list                    # All deltas
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status list --complexity Easy  # Filter by complexity
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py status show DELTA-ID           # Detailed view
```

## Priority Tracking

Deltas have a priority level (1-5) that determines their urgency:

| Level | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Critical | Blocks release, must do now |
| 2 | High | Important, needed soon |
| 3 | Medium | Standard priority (default) |
| 4 | Low | Nice to have |
| 5 | Backlog | Someday/maybe |

Set priority:
```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority set DELTA-ID LEVEL
```

List by priority:
```bash
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority list                  # Grouped by priority
python ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/deltas.py priority list --level 1        # Filter by level
```
