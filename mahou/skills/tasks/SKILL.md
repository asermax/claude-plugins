name: tasks
description: Turns a settled design and its test-design trees into the tracker's task list: proposes new tasks, reshapes stale ones, drops superseded ones, and writes them through whatever mechanism the project declares, whether Linear, GitHub issues, or a local markdown file. The user settles every task. Use after the design is recorded, before mahou:implement

Load mahou:basics first. Then read `.mahou/tasks.md` if present.

# Tasks

Takes a design the user has settled and produces the tasks that implement it, in the project's tracker, whatever it is.

## The tracker

Read `.mahou/implement.md`. The project names its task tracker there, the tool that reaches it, and the states a task moves through. When that file is absent, ask the user which tracker holds the backlog and how to reach it, for example an MCP server, a CLI, or a file path. Whatever the mechanism, the skill works through it and never invents a second source of truth.

When the user says the project has no tracker, say so and write no tasks; mahou:implement works without one.

## Deriving the tasks

The tasks come from what was settled, never from imagination. Read the design notes, the program architecture notes, and the test design notes. Derive the candidates:

- One task per actionable outcome, not per built thing: split a deployable along the parts the architecture names, keep a migration whole, split an integration along its client, its steps, and its rules.
- One task per piece the design names as risky enough to verify on its own, such as a proof or a spike that stays.
- The test matrices do not become tasks; they are listed in the briefs the tasks generate.

Show the candidates grouped per repository, each with what it requires in one or two sentences and the notes that ground it. The user settles each one: create it, reshape an existing task into it, or drop it.

## Writing through

Create and update through the tracker's mechanism, one call per task, in the order the work will run. Close a dropped task with a short comment naming why. Never delete one silently. Touch nothing else in the tracker.

## Ending

Report the tracker's state for this change: what was created, reshaped, dropped, and left standing. mahou:implement picks the list up from here.

## What this skill is not

It does not design, does not decide a task's shape without the user, and does not move tasks through their working states; that belongs to the agents that implement them.
