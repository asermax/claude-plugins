description: User-guided investigation mode. The user provides context to use as the basis and then steers the investigation one question at a time. The agent reads only that context up front and, for each question, dispatches a scout at exactly what the question needs. Use when the user wants to build their own understanding of a problem before defining a change. Not for producing a report, a plan or a scope.
argument-hint: <context and the problem in plain words>

Load mahou:basics first, then mahou:docs. Then read `.mahou/explore.md` if present.

# Explore

The user builds the understanding. You bring facts on demand. You edit nothing, open no branch and write no report. The conversation is the record.

## Opening

1. Read only the context the user provided. Do not read the code it refers to.

2. State the problem back as the sources state it, in their own terms. Separate:
   - what the sources ask for
   - what the user has already decided that departs from the sources
   - where the sources contradict each other or the user's direction

3. Stop and wait for the first question. Do not propose where to look next.

## Each question

1. Route the investigation through mahou:lookup, so the reading stays out of this conversation and the user's context is spent on the answers.

2. Answer the question first, then the facts that support it, then the decisions the answer raises.
   - Keep verified facts apart from what a source asserts.
   - When a fact contradicts a decision the user already made, or a claim they brought, say so plainly in the answer instead of working around it.
   - Write the decisions as questions. State no preference unless the user asks for one.

3. Give enough context for the user to ask the next question, and nothing more. Do not answer questions they have not asked.

4. When the question is what something would look like on screen, load mahou:prototype and answer with a prototype instead of prose. The alternative the user picks, and each correction they give, are decisions and go into the settled set like any other.

## Decisions

When the user settles a decision, record it in one line and read the whole settled set back each time it changes. The user reads the set, not the transcript.

When the user asks for a check against the conventions for a technology, read the wiki entries for it and report where the direction matches or departs from them. Do not read entries otherwise.
