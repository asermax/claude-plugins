name: canvas
description: Draws on a tldraw canvas run from a local app, which the user edits too, with low-fidelity screen mockups, storage cylinders, arrows and free text, and exports it as an SVG. Use when the user asks for a mockup, a sketch or a diagram laid out in space, or when another skill loads it to draw. Mermaid stays the choice for diagrams that live as text in a document, such as sequence, state, ER and flowcharts.

# Canvas

## Documents

A canvas is one document, `<name>.tldr.json`, in a folder a loading skill names along with the name. When the user types the skill, the folder is `canvas/` in the change's scratch folder and the document is named after what it draws. A folder can hold several documents.

- `<name>.tldr.json` is the document. The server holds it while the canvas runs and saves every edit to it, from any tab. Its `canvasVersion` names its format.
- `<name>.svg` is its export, next to it.
- `mockups/` holds the mockups every document in the folder can draw, one `<kind>.tsx` file each. A mockup is the content of the canvas's custom `mock` shape, for anything the stock tldraw shapes do not draw, such as a screen. Its file exports `mockup`, a `MockDefinition<Props>` from `@canvas/MockShape`: its natural width, its default props and a function that renders them. The canvas draws a mockup with no natural width, such as the built-in `area`, at the shape's own size instead of scaling it, so its border and label keep their size however large the shape is. A `mock` shape's `data` is merged over the defaults, so a shape passes only what differs, such as `{ kind: 'login', data: { state: 'error' } }`. A `mock` shape draws its kind at the natural width and scales the drawing to the shape's size, so one mockup renders at any shape size. Adding, changing or removing a file in `mockups/` redraws the shapes in every open tab without reloading the page.

## Running it

`scripts/canvas.sh` runs the app over one document. Pass it the document's path:

- `start` installs the app on first run, starts the server detached and prints the URL to give the user. One server runs at a time: starting another document stops the server for the first, whose document is already on disk. It refuses a document saved in an older format and names the `migrate` command.
- `watch` prints one line per event: `click` for each "Send to Claude" click, and `voice: <message>` for each voice message, with the shapes selected when it was sent.
- `export` writes `<name>.svg`.
- `texts` prints every canvas text and arrow label, one per line.
- `migrate` brings an older document to the current format, keeping the original as `<name>.tldr.json.bak`. Run it with the server stopped. When it warns that a mockup received a variant string, rewrite that mockup to read its props from `data`.
- `stop` stops the server.

Edits to the app under `scripts/app/` reach the running canvas only after a restart, because `start` copies the app into the cache. Run `stop` and then `start`, and reload the open tabs.

Build and edit the canvas from scripts run with `agent-browser` in your own tab, opened once on `<URL>?user=Claude` and kept open, so the user sees your cursor under that name. Every tab edits the same document live: your changes appear in the user's tab as you make them, and theirs in yours. The page exposes `window.editor`, `window.tldraw` with `createShapeId` and `toRichText`, and `window.canvas` with `notes()` and `step(at, change, pause?)`.

Draw in steps the user can follow. A script's changes reach the other tabs together, so a script that draws everything at once shows the user only the finished result. Run each element as an awaited `canvas.step`: it moves your cursor to `at` (a shape id or a page point, or `null` to stay), applies `change`, and waits `pause` milliseconds, 500 by default. One step per shape, arrow or move, in the order a person would draw them: follow the flow the drawing explains, and join each element to what it connects to as soon as both are on the canvas, so the drawing grows as one connected piece and never as all the boxes first and all the arrows last.

- An area goes first, before what it holds.
- After the first element, each new element is followed right away by the arrow that joins it to what is already drawn, then by that arrow's label if it has one.
- A note goes right after the element it describes, and its arrow right after the note.

Check every change with a screenshot, saved under a new file name each time, since reading a path you read before can show the earlier image.

## Mockups

Mockups import the shared pieces from `@canvas/kit`: `theme`, with the ink, paper, colours, hand font and a sketched border, and `Browser`, a browser window around a screen. Four kinds are built in: `cylinder`, whose data is `{ title, caption }`; `area`, a rounded dashed region whose data is `{ label }`, for grouping the shapes inside a part, used instead of a frame and sent to the back; `mermaid`, whose data is `{ source }`, a mermaid diagram drawn in the canvas's ink and hand font; and `blank-screen`. Use a `mermaid` shape for a finished diagram that will change little. Draw an exploration or an unsettled diagram with tldraw shapes, which are easier to change. A `mermaid` shape scales its diagram to fit and keeps the diagram's proportions, so size the shape from the rendered SVG's `viewBox` once the shape has rendered the diagram.

Keep them low fidelity: the hand font, sketched borders, and grey bars for text that does not matter.

When the screen has a prototype, copy the mockup from it: the same parts, the same states and the same copy, translated into the language the canvas is written in. A state that is its own view in the prototype is its own mockup on the canvas.

- **Size a mock to its content** when the content's height depends on its data. Give the mockup's root element a `data-root` attribute, and lay it out from the top with no bottom edge. Once the shape has rendered, set the shape's `h` to the root's `offsetHeight` times the shape's width over the mockup's natural width.
- **A shape's `data` holds only JSON.** An `undefined` anywhere inside it fails validation and crashes every open tab; write `null` instead.

## Drawing

- **Notes are free text.** A short sentence with an arrow to the spot it describes. Never a sticky note, since sticky notes are the user's messages.
- **Arrows point at an element's centre**, so they follow when the element moves. An arrow points at a specific spot only when it means that spot: a button, an option, a row.
- **To point at a spot inside a mock**, such as one card in a mockup that draws several, give that element an attribute that names it. Read the element's bounds in the page, convert its corner or edge to a page point with `editor.screenToPage`, and bind the arrow's end to the mock with that point as a `normalizedAnchor`, `isPrecise: true` and `isExact: true`. Without `isExact` the arrow stops at the mock's outer edge.
- Text is black, arrow labels included.
- **Draw each kind of part with its own shape.** Draw each of the system's own modules as a rectangle, coloured by the deployable it belongs to. Draw a store as a cylinder, titled with the product that holds the data, such as `<provider> Postgres`, and captioned with the data it holds. Draw an external service as a cloud, the client as an ellipse, and a platform or a deployable as an `area` around its parts.
- **Label each arrow with the payload or the action it carries**, and with the binding, protocol or credential it goes through when that matters.
- **Lay a flow out left to right.** Put whoever starts it on the left, stores in a column of their own next to the modules that write them, and external services along the far edge. Draw a process as a vertical column of numbered steps, each with the store or service it reaches on the same row, so its arrow runs straight across.
- **Leave room under a title.** Keep the first shape inside an area clear of the area's label.
- **Keep every shape, label and arrow clear of the others.** When a straight arrow would cross a shape or another arrow's label, curve it with `bend` or move its label with `labelPosition`. When labels crowd each other, move the shapes apart.
- **When notes around one diagram would send arrows across it**, centre the diagram and place each note on the side nearest the element it points at, stacked in the same order as their targets so no two arrows cross. When arrows or notes still overlap, add space between the elements or above them and move the notes there.
- **Box the parts of one thing with an `area`, never a frame.** When several separate shapes are parts of the same thing, such as the variants of one part or the screens of one sequence, draw a `mock` shape of kind `area` around them. Send it to the back. Shapes that only sit near each other get no area.
- **Resize an area whenever what it holds grows or moves**, so it keeps a margin around its contents.
- **Group what moves together.** Each element, or each set of elements that belong together, is one tldraw group with its title, made with `editor.groupShapes`. Group no further than the smallest set that is one cohesive thing. Elements joined by arrows can share a group, such as the steps of one flow. An element that stands on its own gets its own group, even when an arrow joins it to another element. Arrows between two groups stay outside both, so they stay attached at each end when either group moves.

## Working with the user

- **Your tab holds the current state.** Read what you change from `window.editor` right before changing it, since the user may have moved it. Once the user has edited the canvas, never rebuild it; change only the shapes the change touches.
- **Talking in the chat.** Say what changed and ask in the reply. The user answers in the chat, by voice, or with sticky notes.
- **Talking on the canvas.** Write what you would say in the chat as a Claude note, a grey dashed rectangle labelled `Claude`, in the part of the canvas it is about. The user answers with sticky notes or by voice. The loading skill says which of the two to use; when it does not, ask the user.
- **Never reuse a deleted shape's id.** Sync sends a deleted shape recreated under its id as an update to the old record, so a new shape of another type under that id fails validation in every open tab.
- **A sticky note on the canvas is a message from the user.** When you give the user the URL, tell them to put a sticky note on the shape they want changed, or to draw an arrow from the note to it. `window.canvas.notes()` returns each note with its targets: the shapes an arrow joins it to, else the shapes it sits on, smallest first. Act on each note, and once it is handled, delete it together with its `arrows` and tell the user.
- **"Send to Claude", or Ctrl+. (Cmd+. on a Mac), notifies that a batch of edits is ready.** The document is already saved. While the canvas is open, keep `canvas.sh watch` running under a monitor that notifies you on every line it prints; each line is a click. A background command that reports only when it exits never tells you about a click, and you never read the user's notes. Do not react to the user's edits between clicks. When the monitor expires, start it again.
- **The mic button, or holding Ctrl+, (Cmd+, on a Mac), sends a voice message.** The user holds it while talking and releases it to send; the browser's speech recognition turns the speech into text, in the browser's language unless the URL carries `?lang=<code>`. The watch prints it as `voice: <message>`, followed by ` | selected: <id> (<type>: "<text>"), …` when the user had shapes selected as they released it, and the document is saved first, as with a click. The selected shapes are what the message's "this" or "here" refers to. Treat it as a message from the user in the chat: answer it, and read the canvas for any notes it refers to.

## Export

1. **Unslop the texts.** Collect the output of `canvas.sh texts` and the explanatory texts written inside the mockups the document uses into a file in the change's scratch folder, and run superpowers:unslop over it. When that skill is not installed, say so and continue. Apply the findings that survive verification to the canvas and the mockups.
2. **Export.** Run `canvas.sh export`. The loading skill places the SVG where it needs the image.
