description: Takes a change from its branches to merged pull requests across one or more repositories, in the order that keeps production safe. Runs release-check first, opens every pull request, babysits them in parallel through review and rebase until they are merged, then walks the confirmed order, watching each merge's CI run and waiting for the user's production confirmation before the next; the release follows each project's own process. Use when the code is written, reviewed locally and ready to ship.

# Land

Coordinates the plugin's skills into one process, from open branches to merged pull requests. It merges no pull request and picks no order on its own.

## Step 1: Check the release

Run mahou:release-check on the repositories in scope. Present its release order and wait until the user confirms it or changes it.

## Step 2: Open the pull requests

Run mahou:create-pull-request once per repository, all together.

Report every PR URL.

## Step 3: Babysit the pull requests

Start one background loop per PR that polls at a fixed interval and exits on the first of these:

- a review arrived with unresolved threads, or findings in its body
- the branch fell behind its base
- a check failed
- the PR was merged

```
gh pr view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json state,mergeStateStatus,statusCheckRollup
```

plus the review threads through the GraphQL API (`gh api graphql`, the `reviewThreads` connection of the pull request, reading `isResolved` per thread). `gh pr checks --watch` blocks on checks, but nothing in `gh` blocks on reviews or merges, so the loop polls.

When a loop exits, handle that PR and start its loop again:

- **Review.** Report the findings and threads verbatim and stop. The user settles what each one means: they answer it in GitHub, or they tell you what to change, and the fixes, commits, pushes and thread resolutions follow their word.
- **Behind its base.** Run mahou:rebase, which never pushes. Report what moved and push once the user confirms.
- **Failed check.** Report the check with its URL and stop for the user.
- **Merged.** Record it.

The user merges the pull request, either in GitHub or by asking you to merge it.

## Step 4: Merge in order

Walk the confirmed order. The release follows each project's own process once its pull request merges; usually the CI publishes the tag on its own. For each repository:

1. Wait until its pull request is merged and the user has confirmed that every repository before it in the order works in production.
2. Watch the CI run the merge triggers:

   ```
   gh run watch <run-id> --repo <owner>/<repo> --exit-status
   ```

   Report the jobs, their conclusions, and the tag when the run publishes one. A failed job stops everything until the user decides.
3. Stop. The next repository starts when the user confirms this one works in production.

## Step 5: Report

One line per repository: PR, merge, the CI result, and the tag when the project's automation published one. Then stop.
